NAME
----
coap_keepalive, coap_context_set_keepalive - work with CoAP keepalive

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*void void coap_context_set_keepalive(coap_context_t *_context_,
unsigned int _seconds_);*

Link with *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-gnutls*,
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl* or
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls* depending on your (D)TLS library
type.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There may be a requirement to send out keepalive traffic when the CoAP session
is idle (no packets have been sent or received for a specified period) to keep,
say, an interim NAT device "warm" with the NAT translation state, or to
periodically check whether the device at the other end of the session
has "gone away".

For DTLS, this is done with the confirmable CoAP (0.00) Ping packet, which
solicits a CoAP RST response.  For TLS, this is done with Coap (7.02) Ping
packet, which solicits a CoAP (7.03) Pong response, all handled by libcoap.

The *coap_context_set_keepalive*() function needs to be called to update the
_context_ with the keepalive for idle traffic timeout of _seconds_.  If
_seconds_ is set to 0, then the sending of keepalives is disabled.  Any sessions
created from this _context_ will use the same _seconds_ value to determine
whether a keepalive "ping" is to be sent out or not.

Applications can track the usage of the receipt of "pings" and receipt of
"responses" by defining the respective handlers to use by using
coap_register_ping_handler() and coap_register_pong_handler().

If the keepalive fails to solicit a response, then this can be tracked by
defining the handler to use by using coap_register_nack_handler() which will
be called with a reason of COAP_NACK_TOO_MANY_RETRIES.

NOTE: *coap_context_set_keepalive*() is supported by both the CoAP client and
CoAP server.
